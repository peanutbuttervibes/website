title: This website is statically generated with Hakyll
---
Instead of the usual 'hello world' first blog post, let's go through how this
static website is generated using Hakyll. Maybe this could help someone
stumbling upon this.

# The reason for choosing Hakyll

Many static website generators exist (e.g. Jekyll in Ruby and Hugo in Go). I
think none of them is as cool as Hakyll, which uses the great Pandoc in its
internal. Also, I haven't got myself to write some Haskell yet --- which has
been on my todo list for quite some time now --- and Hakyll seems like a
perfect gentle way to get started. *Filling two needs with one deed*.
